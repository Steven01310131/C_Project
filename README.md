LU factorization and N-body simulation. In both projects, the code has been optimized and parallelized.

LU factorization is a numerical method used for solving systems of linear equations. The algorithm involves decomposing a matrix into a lower triangular matrix and an upper triangular matrix. This decomposition is useful for solving systems of linear equations and is widely used in scientific computing.

The LU factorization code has been optimized and parallelized to improve its performance. The optimization techniques used include loop unrolling, cache optimization, and vectorization. The code has also been parallelized using OpenMP to take advantage of multi-core processors.

N-body simulation is a computational technique used in astrophysics to study the motion of a group of celestial objects, such as stars or galaxies, under the influence of gravity. The simulation involves solving a set of differential equations that describe the motion of the objects.

The N-body simulation code has also been optimized and parallelized to improve its performance. The optimization techniques used include reducing memory access, optimizing the data structures, and using more efficient algorithms. The code has been parallelized using MPI to distribute the workload across multiple processors and achieve better scalability.

Overall, both projects demonstrate the importance of code optimization and parallelization in scientific computing to achieve faster and more accurate results.
